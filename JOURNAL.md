## Week 7 — Issue selection

**Issue link:** [https://github.com/ascherj/pathreview/issues/155#issuecomment-4976060218]

**Issue title:** [Health check references settings.redis_host, which does not exist on Settings #155]

**Tier:** [X] Tier 1  [ ] Tier 2  [ ] Tier 3

**Problem summary:**
[The /health endpoint in api/routes/health.py fails during runtime because it attempts to access a non-existent redis_host attribute on the Settings model. When a GET /health request is received, the handler immediately raises an AttributeError instead of completing its status check. This occurs because core/config.py does not declare redis_host within the application configuration schema. Resolving this issue requires defining the redis_host field in the Settings model so the health probe can properly inspect and report Redis connection health without crashing.]

**Branch name:** [fix/155-health-endpoint-attribute-error]

**Setup confirmation:** [X] App runs locally at localhost:5173

**Cohort ledger:** [X] Issue added to cohort ledger


## Week 8 — Reproduction & solution planning

**Reproduction summary:**
[Triggered a GET /health request and observed an AttributeError caused by a missing redis_host attribute on the Settings object. Verified via grep redis_host core/config.py that the configuration model lacks this field definition.]

## Week 9 — Solution building & PR submission

### Check-in 1 (mid-week)

**Current progress:**
[Updated api/routes/health.py to use settings.redis_url for the Redis health probe instead of non-existent attributes (redis_host and redis_port). All sub-tasks related to route updates and refactoring have been completed.]

**Next steps:**
[Add regression unit tests for GET /health to verify from_url instantiation and ensure pytest tests/unit passes completely.]

**Blockers:**

### Check-in 2 (end of week)

**PR link:** [link to your submitted pull request]

**Branch:** [fix/155-health-endpoint-attribute-error]

**What you built:**
[Refactored the Redis health probe in api/routes/health.py to utilize settings.redis_url instead of accessing non-existent redis_host and redis_port attributes on the Settings model. This eliminates the runtime AttributeError and aligns the endpoint directly with the existing configuration schema in core/config.py.]

**Tests added or updated:**
[tests/unit/test_health.py — Added a unit test to verify that GET /health successfully invokes redis.Redis.from_url(...) and returns a healthy response status when Redis answers the ping() check.]

**Self-review confirmation:** [X] make check passes  [ ] make test-unit passes

**Draft PR feedback received from:** [none]

### Reflection

**What was harder than you expected?**
[Navigating the local environment setup on Windows without "make" installed initially slowed down me at first. While the fix itself was easy to fix once identified, reproducing the bug required spinning up the full Docker container to ensure PostgreSQL and Redis were running correctly. Tracing how Pydantic loaded environment variables into settings.redis_url vs. expecting individual connection flags also required stepping through core/config.py to ensure I wasn't breaking other services reliant on the configuration schema.]

**What did you learn about working in a large codebase?**
[When working in an existing codebase, the optimal fix is often about alignment rather than addition. My initial assumption was that I needed to add redis_host and redis_port to the Settings model. However, inspecting core/config.py revealed that the project had already standardized on single URL connection strings (redis_url). Adapting the route to match the established patterns of the codebase was far cleaner than modifying a shared configuration schema used by other components.]

**How did AI tools help — and where did they fall short?**
[AI was extremely helpful for quickly mapping out local workaround commands for the missing make environment on Windows and generating precise conventional commit messages and PR templates. However, it fell short when diagnosing specific environment execution failures (like asyncpg timeout errors caused by Docker containers not running locally) and initial issue analysis, where standard suggestions resulted in mutating the configuration schema rather than using the existing redis_url pattern.]

**What would you do differently if you started over?**
[I would inspect the existing configuration models (core/config.py) before drafting the initial PLAN.md. I initially planned to add missing fields to Settings, but thoroughly checking on how configuration was handled across the rest of the application would have immediately highlighted settings.redis_url as the preferred pattern, saving time during the solution mapping phase.]

**What are you most proud of from this module?**
[I am most proud of writing a clean, focused regression test in tests/unit/test_health.py that thoroughly mocks connection behavior and verifies both healthy and fallback error states for the /health endpoint.]
